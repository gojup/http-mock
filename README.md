# http-mock

HTTP mocking and expectations library for Haskell

## Status
This project is aiming to provide a complete http mocking 
system for allow developers of http client libraries to test
their clients.

Currently the project is very basic and is limited to allow
connect a http-client to a Wai `Application`. This is enough
to build any kind of mock server.
